        <p>
            When working with a <code>UIViewController</code> one of the most used pieces of functionality is dismissing the view
            controller. As more and more projects where created and more and more <code>UIViewController</code> classes were created
            it was noticed that the same piece of code was continually being written over and over again.
        </p>

        <h4>Dismiss Modal View Controller Code</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint">
- (IBAction)dismiss:(id)sender
{
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}
</pre>

        <p>
            The <code>IBAction</code> from the above code will allow the user to attach an event from the Interface Builder to this
            method and dismiss the currently displayed <code>UIViewController</code>. Since animated is <code>YES</code> it will
            perform a default iOS animation unless you have overridden the animation in your <code>UIViewController</code> delegate.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was therefore determined that a category could be created on the <code>UIViewController</code> object that would have
            this code already pre-written and hence you would only ever have to include the category in your project and
            the functionality would be there in one place. This category would be very simple incorporating the code
            written above along with two other useful category methods. The full category is shown below.
        </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
@implementation UIViewController (DTFDismiss)

- (IBAction)dtf_dismissViewController:(id)sender
{
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}

- (IBAction)dtf_popViewController:(id)sender
{
    [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}

- (IBAction)dtf_popToRootViewController:(id)sender
{
    [self.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}

@end

</pre>

        <p>
            The two extra category methods associated with the <code>UIViewController</code> are based on using a <code>UINavigationController</code>
            with the functionality and pop the current view off the <code>UINavigationController</code> stack or alternatively the
            second option will pop all of the view controllers off the <code>UINavigationController</code> stack and return you to
            the root view controller for the <code>UINavigationController</code>.<br/>
        </p>

        <h3>Controlling the Animated Portion</h3>
        <p>
            From the above code snipet you only have the ability to set the animation value while dismissing the view controller to <code>YES</code>.
            From a developer perspective this is a limitation since the methods would have to be duplicated with the appropriate <code>NO</code> or <code>YES</code>
            values for each animation depending which is not what we want to achieve in any helper methods being created.
            Since the main aspect of this library is to allow you to utilize the Storyboard it would be better if the
            library also allowed you to control the animation property from the Storyboard. Initially for this it was
            assumed you could just put a property in the Storyboard key/value pairs for the object and this would allow
            you to have access to what the user wished.
        </p>

        <img class="displayed"
             alt=""
             src="uiviewcontrollerdismiss/storyboard-key-value.png"
             height="508"
             width="526" />

        <p>
            Putting the above key path into the Storyboard file as shown above will cause the application to crash when
            the view controller / specifically the button is unarchived from the Storyboard file. The reason for this is
            the property does not exist on the button and hence when it is set the button does not respond to the selector
            and the application crashes. In order to get around this issue we need to create a category on the objects that
            we wish this functionality from the Storyboard upon. In this case it was determined to put the category on
            NSObject since this covers all of the necessary objects because UIBarButtonItem does not inherit from UIView
            so NSObject is the first in both UIButton and UIBarButtonItem hierarchies that matches both of the items most
            likely to utilize this functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            The NSObject+DTFDismissAnimate category utilizes the Objective C runtime in order to allow creation of a new
            property on a class without subclassing the class. Using the Objective C runtime <code>objc_setAssociatedObject</code>
            and <code>objc_getAssociated</code> methods we can simulate the <code>NSObject</code> class having the new runtime property
            <code>dtfDismissAnimate</code>. As seen below the category is using the <code>NSNumber</code> class to store the value. This
            behavior was required because we cannot associate anything which is not an object and <code>NSNumber</code> allows the application
            to store <code>BOOLEAN</code> values and retrieve the values where requested.
        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

@interface NSObject (DTFDismissAnimate)

@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL dtfDismissAnimate;

@end

#import &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt;

static const void *kDTFDismissAnimateKey = &amp;kDTFDismissAnimateKey;

@implementation NSObject (DTFDismissAnimate)

- (void)setDtfDismissAnimate:(BOOL)dtfDismissAnimate
{
    objc_setAssociatedObject(self, kDTFDismissAnimateKey, @(dtfDismissAnimate), OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN);
}

- (BOOL)dtfDismissAnimate
{
    NSNumber *associated = objc_getAssociatedObject(self, kDTFDismissAnimateKey);
    return associated ? [associated boolValue] : NO;
}

@end
</pre>

        <p>
            As can be seen the header file just declares the property <code>dtfDismissAnimate</code> as a BOOL property. This
            property will be used as any other property on an object for holding the value of the animation. In the implementation
            of the category we declare a static constant key that shall hold the value of the property on the object. We
            have to implement the getter and setter manually since Objective C will not synthesize them for us. The getter is just a
            simple lookup on the object for the value associated with the <code>kDTFDismissAnimateKey</code>. If a value exists
            it will be returned otherwise a default of <code>NO</code> is returned since we cannot return <code>nil</code> when the return
            type is not an object. Now we have the category defined running the application and loading the view controller
            containing the button with our <code>dtfDismissAnimate</code> key path will no longer crash the application but allow
            the <code>UIViewController</code> category to retrieve the value from the user defined Storyboard value and either animate or
            not animate the transition of dismissing the view controller.
        </p>

        <h3>Storyboard Setup</h3>

        <p>
            Once you have all of the files setup in your project, you can now utilize the storyboard to setup dismissing the
            modal view controller. Dragging from the <code>UIBarButtonItem</code> in the case below to the <code>UIViewController</code> will popup the
            choices and inside the actions choices you will see the three choices made available by the category. Choosing the
            <code>dtf_dismissViewController</code> method will allow the application to dismiss the view controller and if
            you set the animation property as shown above then this will determine whether the view controller is dismissed with
            an animation or not.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            This category is useful to avoid code duplication across multiple view controllers. The ability to set the animation
            property also provides the user with the advantage of being able to configure everything through the Storyboard without
            having to go into the code base itself and change properties or add any additional code. The category code for this blog
