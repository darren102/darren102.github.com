        <p>
            Objective-C as a language has been around since the early 1980s and thus is a very mature language compared to the newer languages such
            as Swift which Apple introduced at WWDC 2014. While Swift is a breath of fresh air in sense of having the Apple development community very
            excited we cannot ignore the fact that many of Apple's current frameworks are for the majority written in Objective-C. With this in mind
            this post attempts to discuss runtime object association which is one of the useful features found in the Objective-C runtime.
            <pre class="prettyprint">#import &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt;</pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Associating Objects</h3>
        <p>
            One of the nice features in the Objective-C runtime is the ability to associate objects with other objects living in the runtime. These objects
            you can associate with can either be your own custom objects or provided objects associated with Apples frameworks (UIView, NSString, etc...).
            One of the main benefits for associating objects is that you can provide extra functionality to objects that you do not own and hence can add
            information without sub-classing.<br/>
            <br/>
            The Objective-C runtime provides the following methods for object association:
            <ul>
                <li>objc_setAssociatedObject - "Sets an associated value for a given object using a given key and association policy" </li>
                <li>objc_getAssociatedObject - "Returns the value associated with a given object for a given key" </li>
                <li>objc_removeAssociatedObjects - "Removes all associations for a given object" </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Implementations</h4>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding an extra property through the runtime</li>
            <li>Using <code>UIAlertView</code> in a similar way to <code>UIAlertController</code></li>
        </ul>

        <b>Adding an extra property through the runtime</b><br/>
        Adding an extra property to an existing object is done through the use of Objective-C category extensions. These categories will provide you the ability
        to change the object on the fly without having to subclass the object. In the scenario below the idea is to add a property to an <code>Area</code> object
        called <code>confidentialName</code>.

<pre class="prettyprint">
#import &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt;
#import &lt;Area.h&gt;

/**
 * Key for associating the value with an object
 */
static void *kAreaConfidentialName = &amp;kAreaConfidentialName; // 1.

@implementation Area (Confidential)

- (NSString*)confidentialName
{
    return objc_getAssociatedObject(self, kAreaConfidentialName); // 2.
}

- (void)setConfidentialName:(NSString*)confidentialName
{
    objc_setAssociatedObject(self, kAreaConfidentialName, confidentialName, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN); // 3.
}

@end
</pre>
        This code presents an implementation to the aforementioned scenario. Here's what's going on in more detail:<br/>
        <ol>
            <li>Key used to set / get associations from the object </li>
            <li>Retrieving the value from the object associated with the key</li>
            <li>Setting the value on the object for the key</li>
        </ol>

        Some points to note about the above is that the key is a static void pointer and it points to the address of itself. The reasoning behind this
        is that for you to be able to access the same information at runtime when getting and setting the key needs to be exactly the same i.e. identical
        otherwise you will never be able to retrieve information that you have set. By declaring the variable static and by utilizing its address we are
        able to guarantee that the key will always point to the same memory address and thus setting and getting the information will work as expected.

        <b>Using UIAlertView in a similar vain to UIAlertController</b><br/>
        One of my pet hates before iOS8 came along with <code>UIAlertController</code> was that you had to utilize the delegate <code>UIAlertViewDelegate</code> in
        order to handle users interacting with a <code>UIAlertView</code>. This was fine when you had one or two <code>UIAlertView's</code> inside your class but if
        more than that number occurred you had to resort to using the <code>tag</code> option and set a numeric tag on each <code>UIAlertView</code> so you could
        later identify them in the delegate as shown below.

<pre class="prettyprint">
@interface ViewController&lt;UIAlertViewDelegate&gt;

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (IBAction)displayAlert:(id)sender
{
    UIAlertView *alertView = [[UIAlertView alloc]
                              initWithTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"Display Alert View 10000", nil)
                                    message:NSLocalizedString(@"Displaying an alert view 10000", nil)
                                   delegate:self
                          cancelButtonTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"Cancel", nil)
                          otherButtonTitles:NSLocalizedString(@"Dismiss", nil),
                             nil];
    alertView.tag = 10000;
    [alertView show];
}

- (IBAction)displayAlert:(id)sender
{
    UIAlertView *alertView = [[UIAlertView alloc]
                              initWithTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"Display Alert View 10001", nil)
                                    message:NSLocalizedString(@"Displaying an alert view 10001", nil)
                                   delegate:self
                          cancelButtonTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"Cancel", nil)
                          otherButtonTitles:NSLocalizedString(@"Dismiss", nil),
                             nil];
    alertView.tag = 10001;
    [alertView show];
}

# pragma mark - UIAlertViewDelegate instance methods (UIALERTVIEWDELEGATE)

- (void)alertView:(UIAlertView *)alertView clickedButtonAtIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex
{
    if (alertView.tag == 10000) {
        // Do something with alertView 10000
    } else if (alertView.tag == 10001) {
        // Do something with alertView 10001
    }
}

@end
</pre>
        As you can see from above this can get very cumbersome having to remember which <code>UIAlertView</code> is answering its delegate call and more to the point
        if you have a large view controller with the alerts spread through the code, it is difficult to know exactly where in the view controller the delegate was
        instantiated and hence know what conditions caused the alert to fire in the first place.<br/>
        The code below shows you how to utilize the Objective-C runtime to achieve a more elegant look:

<pre class="prettyprint">
#import &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt;

/**
 * Key to hold the block of code to run inside the UIAlertViewDelegate method
 */
static void *kAlertViewDelegateCodeKey = &amp;kAlertViewDelegateCodeKey;

@interface ViewController&lt;UIAlertViewDelegate&gt;

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (IBAction)displayAlert:(id)sender
{
    // 1.
    UIAlertView *alertView = [[UIAlertView alloc]
             initWithTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"Unsaved Changes", nil)
                   message:NSLocalizedString(@"You will lose your unsaved changes. Are you sure?", nil)
                  delegate:self
         cancelButtonTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"No", nil)
         otherButtonTitles:NSLocalizedString(@"Yes", nil), nil];

    // 2.
    objc_setAssociatedObject(alertView, kAlertViewDelegateCodeKey, ^(NSInteger buttonIndex) {
        if (buttonIndex == 1) {
            // Do something if the user decides Yes
        }
    }, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_COPY);
    [alertView show];
}

# pragma mark - UIAlertViewDelegate instance methods (UIALERTVIEWDELEGATE)

- (void)alertView:(UIAlertView *)alertView clickedButtonAtIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex
{
    // 3.
    void (^codeBlock)(NSInteger) = objc_getAssociatedObject(alertView, kAlertViewDelegateCodeKey);
    // 4.
    if (codeBlock) {
        codeBlock(buttonIndex);
    }
}

@end
</pre>
        The code presents an implementation of utilizing the associations to keep your alert firing code and delegate code together in the same method.
        Here's what's going on in more detail:
        <ol>
            <li>Creating the <code>UIAlertView</code> we wish to display in the application </li>
            <li>Setting an association on the <code>alertView</code> that shall be run inside the delegate </li>
            <li>Retrieving the delegate code block associated with the <code>alertView</code></li>
            <li>Verifying we actually have a valid code block since calling this while <code>nil</code> will result in a crash</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Removing Associations</h3>
        The association with the object can be removed programatically or through the objects natural lifecycle coming to an end and thus once it is deallocated
        the association will of coure be removed automatically by the system. The code below shows the two ways to remove the association programatically:

<pre class="prettyprint">
#import &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt;

/**
 * Key to hold the associated object
 */
static void *kAssociatedObjectKey = &amp;kAssociatedObjectKey;

@implementation ViewController

- (IBAction)removeSingleAssociatedObject:(id)sender
{
    // 1.
    objc_setAssociatedObject(self, kAssociatedObjectKey, nil, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_COPY);
}

- (IBAction)removeAllAssociatedObjects:(id)sender
{
    // 2.
    objc_removeAssociatedObjects(self);
}

@end
</pre>
        The code shows an implementation of removing associations at runtime from an object. Here's what's going on in more detail:
        <ol>
            <li>Setting the object to <code>nil</code> for a specific key removes the association at runtime</li>
            <li>Removes all associated objects regardless of who set them. Only use if you know you want a clean object</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Objective-C Runtime Association Policies</h3>
        While going through this post you may have noticed that when setting the associated object we are utilizing the OBJC_ASSOCIATION_COPY as the last parameter in the method.
        If you look through the <code>runtime.h</code> file and find the declaration you will notice that this is an Association Policy which determines how the value / object shall
        be associated when calling the method. Possible values are listed below:
        <ul>
            <li><code>OBJC_ASSOCIATION_ASSIGN</code> - associated object will have a weak reference</li>
            <li><code>OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN_NONATOMIC</code> - associated object will have a strong reference made nonatomically</li>
            <li><code>OBJC_ASSOCIATION_COPY_NONATOMIC</code> - associated object is copied and the association is made nonatomically</li>
            <li><code>OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN</code> - associated object has a strong reference and it is made atomically</li>
            <li><code>OBJC_ASSOCIATION_COPY</code> - associated object is copied and it is made atomically</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        The Objective-C runtime is a very powerful beast and this post just touches the tip of the iceberg in terms of what you can achieve by manipulation the runtime. With the release
        of iOS8 and the <code>UIAlertController</code> class the need for supporting the associated on <code>UIAlertView's</code> has diminished, however if you have to support any devices
        running a version less than iOS8 it could still become a useful tool in your toolbox for keeping your code cleaner and neater.
